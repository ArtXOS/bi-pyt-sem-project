=== GRAPHIC EDITOR

This CLI program is intended for applying different filters(transformations) on images.

.You can use these filters(transformations):
* Right rotate 90Â°: --rotate or -r option
* Mirroring: --mirror or -m option
* inverse filter: --inverse or -i option
* Convert to grayscale: --bw or -b option
* Lighten: --lighten <percentage: 0-100> or -l <percentage: 0-100>
* Darken: --darken <percentage: 0-100> or -d <percentage: 0-100>
* Unsharp masking: --sharpen or -s option

== Program usage:
In project root folder type command:

`python editor.py [-h | --help] [-r | --rotate] [-m | --mirror] [-i | --inverse] [-b | --bw] [-s | --sharpen] [-l LIGHTEN] [-d DARKEN] INPUT_IMAGE_PATH OUTPUT_IMAGE_PATH`

.Required arguments are:
* INPUT_IMAGE_PATH path to the image which you want to work with
* OUTPUT_IMAGE_PATH path, where you want to save the edited image
* select at least one transformation(filter)

You are not limited in using optional arguments(filters) as many times as you wish. It means, that you can apply, for example, inverting a few times while editing, or rotate the image twice with '-r -r'. You have to remember, that transformations will be applied in order they were typed in command line

== Testing:
Test the program with 'pytest'
